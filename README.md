# RBFDenseUNet
A UNet architecture with Dense blocks, and an RBF output layer.

An RBF based artificial neural networks used for the purpose of semantic image segmentation. The backbone of this model is a DenseUNet with an Rbf output layer. The models allows inference using Bayes Theorem, or Softmax, or both. 

The dataset can be found in this repo: https://github.com/yalaudah/facies_classification_benchmark
